# Tree

A tree is a collection of entities called nodes. Nodes are connected by edges. The first node of the tree is called the root. If this root node is connected by another node, the root is then a parent node and the connected node is a child.

* **Root** is the topmost node of the tree.
* **Edge** is the link between two nodes.
* **Child** is a node that has a parent node.
* **Parent** is a node that has an edge to a child node.
* **Leaf** is a node that does not have a child node in the tree.
* **Height** is the length of the longest path to a leaf.
* **Depth** is the length of the path to its root.

* **Tree traversal**:
  * **DFS** “is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure. One starts at the root and explores as far as possible along  each branch before backtracking.” — Wikipedia
    * Pre-order
    * Post-order
    * In-order
  * **BFS** “is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure. It starts at the tree root and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.” — Wikipedia
