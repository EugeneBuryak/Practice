# Dynamic Array

Dynamic arrays are arrays that can scale capacity dynamically.

## Complexity

|                            | Time |
| ---                        | ---  |
| Access                     | Θ(1) |
| Search                     | O(n) |
| Insert/delete at beginning | Θ(n) |
| Insert/delete at end       | α(1) |
| Insert/delete in middle    | Θ(n) |

α(n) - amortized
