# Singly linked list

In a singly linked list, each node stores a reference to an object that is an element of the sequence, as well as a reference to the next node of the list. It does not store any pointer or reference to the previous node.

## Complexity

|                            | Time |
| ---                        | ---  |
| Remove at head             | Θ(1) |
| Remove at tail             | Θ(n) |
| Remove at                  | Θ(n) |
| Insert at head             | Θ(1) |
| Insert at tail             | Θ(1) |
| Search                     | Θ(n) |
