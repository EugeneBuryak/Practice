# Doubly Linked List

A Doubly Linked List contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.

## Complexity

|                            | Time |
| ---                        | ---  |
| Remove at head             | Θ(1) |
| Remove at tail             | Θ(1) |
| Remove at                  | Θ(n) |
| Insert at head             | Θ(1) |
| Insert at tail             | Θ(1) |
| Insert at                  | Θ(n) |
| Search                     | Θ(n) |
